# Generative-AI

Documenting the learning journey of the Generative AI.

What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is an artificial intelligence which can generate the text,image,video or vioces/musics from the prompts or any kind of user inputs.

**AI Models**
There are two type of models:
**1)GPT Models** -- Which are fast and also don't take time to generate.Gives instatnt output.
**2)Reasoning models** -- which are specially made for thinking capabilities,in which the model will think for some seconds and generate the output based on the prompt that are given.

All models work on the basis of the **Neural Network** which is basically the thinking brain of the models, On basis of these Neural Networks weights of information the models are been parameterized like 7b(billion).

**Key Aspects must be known before learning the Generative AI or Models of the AI**
**1)Tokens** -- The smallest unit of the text the model processes,like words or parts of words.
**2)Context **-- The surrounding text or information the model uses to understand and generate relevant responses.
**3)Context Window** -- The maximum number of tokens an LLM can read and use at the same time to generate or predict text. 
for example: GPT 3 : 2048 Tokens allowed
             GPT 4.1 : 10,47,576 Tokens allowed
**4)Inference** -- The process where an LLM takes input text and generates an output based on what it has learned.            

**Prompt Engineering**
Used to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as quesion answering and arithmetic reasoning.

**Prompt**
A prompt is simply the text you send to LLM.

**Elements of the prompt**
1)Instructions
2)Input Data
3)Context
4)Output Indicator

**Zero shot prompting**
Giving the single shot or direct question or prompt as the input 
ex:Write me an email regarding holiday.
